Que-9. What is RAID, and what are some common RAID configurations?
Ans. RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent (or Inexpensive) Disks.
     It’s a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical        drives into one logical unit for performance, redundancy, or both.

     Think of it like a squad of drives working together like a team — some focus on        speed, others on backup, and some do both.

     Redundancy = protection from drive failure (fail-safe).
     Speed = better read/write performance (data hustle).
     Scalability = more storage and flexibility.

     Common RAID Configurations:
     1. RAID 0 – Striping
     Performance beast, No redundancy.

     Data is split across 2+ drives — faster read/write speeds.

     If one drive fails? You lose everything.
     Use case: video editing, gaming (where speed is king, and data isn’t mission- critical).

     2. RAID 1 – Mirroring
     Full redundancy, Storage space cut in half.

     Data is mirrored (duplicated) across two drives.

     One fails? You’re still chillin' — data's safe on the other.
     
     Use case: important documents, servers, personal backups.

     3. RAID 5 – Striping with Parity
     Balanced speed + redundancy, needs 3+ drives.

     Data is striped across drives, with parity data for recovery.

     Can survive 1 drive failure.

     Use case: medium-sized servers, NAS setups.

     4. RAID 6 – Striping with Dual Parity
     Like RAID 5, but can survive 2 drive failures.

     High fault tolerance, Slower write performance.

     Needs 4+ drives.

     Use case: enterprise-grade storage with mission-critical data.

     5. RAID 10 (1+0) – Mirrored Striping
     Combines RAID 0 speed + RAID 1 redundancy.

     Needs at least 4 drives.

     High speed + redundancy, Higher cost (half usable storage).

     Use case: high-performance databases, gaming servers, virtualization.

Que-10. Demonstrate how to replace a CPU fan in a desktop computer.
Ans. 1. Power Off and Unplug
	Shut down the computer properly.
	Unplug the power cable from the wall and switch off the power supply.
	Wait a few minutes to ensure any residual electricity discharges.

     2. Ground Yourself
	Wear an anti-static wrist strap or touch a grounded metal object to prevent 	electrostatic discharge that could damage components.

     3. Open the Case
	Use a screwdriver to remove the side panel (typically the left side).
	Lay the case flat on its side so the motherboard is facing up.

     4. Locate the CPU Fan
	Find the CPU cooler on top of the processor socket on the motherboard.
	It will be connected to the CPU_FAN header via a small 4-pin (or sometimes 3-	pin) cable.

     5. Disconnect the Fan Cable
	Gently unplug the fan's power cable from the motherboard header.

     6. Remove the Old CPU Fan and Heatsink
	Depending on the type of cooler:
	For stock Intel or AMD coolers, unscrew or unclip the mounting system.
	Carefully twist the heatsink slightly to loosen thermal paste if it feels 	stuck — never yank it straight up.
	Lift the fan and heatsink off the CPU.

     7. Clean Off Old Thermal Paste
	Use isopropyl alcohol (90% or higher) and a lint-free cloth or paper towel to 	clean the old thermal paste from both the CPU and the bottom of the heatsink 	or fan base.

	Let it dry completely.

     8. Apply New Thermal Paste
	Apply a small, pea-sized amount of thermal paste in the center of the CPU.
	No need to spread it — the pressure of the heatsink will do that.

     9. Install the New CPU Fan
	Align the new fan and heatsink with the CPU socket.
	Carefully lower it straight down onto the CPU.
	Secure it using the mounting mechanism (screws, clips, or brackets, depending 	on the cooler type).

    10. Reconnect the Fan Cable
	Plug the fan’s power cable into the CPU_FAN header on the motherboard.

    11. Close the Case and Power On
	Reattach the side panel.
	Plug in the power cable and turn on the PSU.

	Boot the PC and enter BIOS or use monitoring software to verify the new fan 	is running and temperatures are stable. 

Que-11. Discuss the importance of regular maintenance for computer hardware and provide examples of maintenance tasks.
Ans. Why Regular Hardware Maintenance Matters
     1. Maximizes Lifespan
	Hardware doesn’t last forever — dust, heat, and mechanical wear all shorten 	its life. Maintenance helps prevent early death of components like fans, hard 	drives, and power supplies.

     2. Boosts Performance
	A clean, well-maintained system runs smoother. Dust and heat throttle 	performance. Loose connections can cause random shutdowns. Regular check-ups 	keep it snappy.

     3. Prevents Downtime
	A failed drive or overheating GPU at the wrong moment? Say goodbye to 	productivity or that all-night Valorant session. Maintenance reduces 	unexpected failures.

     4. Protects Data
	Drives degrade silently. Without checks, you won’t see failure coming until 	it’s too late. Regular health scans and backups protect your digital assets.

Common Hardware Maintenance Tasks
     1. Dust Removal
	Use compressed air or an anti-static vacuum to blow out dust from:

	CPU fans

	GPU

	Power supply

	Motherboard and case vents

	Frequency: Every 1–3 months, depending on your environment.

     2. Check and Replace Thermal Paste
	Over time, thermal paste dries out, reducing CPU and GPU cooling efficiency.

	Reapply every 1–2 years or when temperatures spike.

     3. Inspect Fans and Cooling Systems
	Make sure all fans are spinning freely, not making noise, and not clogged.

	Replace any worn-out fans immediately.

     4. Cable Management
	Clean and re-route cables to improve airflow and reduce the risk of 	disconnection or interference.

     5. Hard Drive/SSD Health Check
	Use SMART tools (e.g., CrystalDiskInfo) to monitor health.

	Watch for bad sectors, high temps, or weird noises in HDDs.

     6. Check for Loose Connections
	Inspect RAM, GPU, storage, and power cables to ensure they're properly 	seated.

     7. Update BIOS/Firmware
	Periodically update your motherboard BIOS and firmware for SSDs or 	peripherals. Just don’t rush it — always follow manufacturer instructions.

     8. Power Supply Check
	Make sure your PSU fan is running.

	Check for dust buildup, capacitor bulges, or odd smells.

	Advanced Maintenance (Optional But Smart)
	Run memory diagnostics (e.g., MemTest86) every 6–12 months.

	Test PSU output if you experience random reboots or shutdowns.

	Check GPU thermal performance using tools like MSI Afterburner.

	Calibrate UPS or surge protectors annually if you're using them.
