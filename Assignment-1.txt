Que-1. Which of the following is NOT the component of the CPU?
Ans. RAM

Que-2. What is the function of RAM in a computer?
Ans. These are semiconductor memories 
     It is known as main memory. 
     Usually volatile memory. 
     Data is lost in case power is switched off. 
     It is working memory of the computer. 
     Faster than secondary memories. 
     A computer cannot run without primary memory. 

Que-3. Which of the following is a primary storage device?
Ans. 1 and 2 both.

Que-4. What is the purpose of a GPU?
Ans. GPU is a specialized processor designed to handle visual output — think      rendering images, animations, and videos — fast and in parallel. But it’s evolved way beyond just graphics.

Que-5. The motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer where the other components are attached.
Ans.  True

Que-6. A UPS(Uninterruptable Power Supply) is a hardware device that provides emergency power to a load when the input power source fails.
Ans. True

Que-7. An expansion card is a circuit board that enhances the functionality of a component.
Ans. True

Que-8. Explain the difference between HDD and SSD?
Ans. HDD :- 
     Random Access Memory.
     Read latency time high.
     50mbps to 100mbps.
     Low reliability.
     HDD have moving parts to fail.
     Relatively large and heavy.
     HDD is available upto 4tb.
     6-12 watts.

     SSD :-
     Solid State Drive
     Read latency very low.
     100mbps to 500mbps.
     High reliability.
     SSD has no moving parts.
     Small and light weight.
     SSD is available upto 2tb.
     Power consumption 2 watts.

Que-9. Describe the function of BIOS in a computer system.
Ans. Instructions used to start the computer system from a cold start.
     The BIOS instructions are written on non-volatile ram.
     EEP-ROM is the common media choice for the BIOS installed on motherboard.
     The BIOS instructions are based on the chip-set installed on the        motherboard.

Que-10. List and briefly explain three input devices commonly used with computers.
Ans. 1) Keyboard
     2) Mouse
     3) Joystick

1) Keyboard :- A primary input device used to type text, numbers, and commands.
            Has keys for letters (A–Z), digits (0–9), function keys (F1–F12),  	   	    control keys (Ctrl, Alt, etc.), and navigation.
            Essential for coding, writing, shortcuts, and pretty much everything 	    digital.
            Types: Mechanical, Membrane, Wireless, Ergonomic. 

2) Mouse :- A pointing device used to control the on-screen cursor.
	    Lets you click, drag, scroll, and interact with GUI elements.
	    Has buttons (left/right), a scroll wheel, and may include side 		    buttons or gestures.
	    Types: Optical, Laser, Wireless, Gaming Mouse with DPI control.

3) Joystick :- An input device mostly used in gaming and simulations (like flight 	       sims).
	       Controls direction and movement with a stick that moves in 		       multiple axes.
	       Often includes buttons and triggers for in-game actions.
	       Used in aviation training, robotics, and accessibility tech too.
